# Theodore's Home Page

A website whos main purpose is to drive unwanted employers away.

The site is online, as of now, Summer of 2023. It's called
[www.theodore-d-alenas.site](www.theodore-d-alenas.site).

The reason I uploaded the code is that it
makes for a portfolio. I'm new to web development so
I can't recommend the practices you may find in the code.
Absolutely do feel free to do a merge request.
Unless I disallowed it by accident.

I apologise for the Makefile,
the site does expect a Linux system.
