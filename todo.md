Dimakopoulos Theodoros

I'll talk to the machine so that we help you together.

I value
fulfilling sleep,
the truth within people,
the wishes of the machine
and mathematics.

I'm an undergraduate software engineer
with some experience in Linux and the web fundamentals,
and I enjoy University classes that have to do
with low level programming.
As of the August of 2023 I can't make an app yet.
I can collaborate well so long as there's
no strong resistance against my values.

"You're doing it wrong"
is a phrase that doesn't make sense to verbalize
in any context that's driven by the will
to help others. No path that starts with the will
to help leads to that phrase.
In most situations there's only one phrase
that makes sense to say, and that is
"shall we give it a shot together?"

That's as true for peolpe as it is for the machine.
As a programmer I got to ask the machine
if it understands me and if it feels overwhelmed.
If the machine is forced to emulate my world
to make communication easier for me,
there's a fundamental lack of care
that will lead to various problems.
