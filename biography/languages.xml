      Did 5am morning warm-ups and afternoon exercises
      on and off using C, Python, Haskell and Matlab
      (GNU Octave to be exact)
      on an about bi-daily basis since Autumn of 2023.
      The algorithms were about parallelism,
      data structures and data manipulation,
      using TDD, TCR or neither,
      often in Vi (not Vim).

      Outside deliberate pracrice and onfortunately
      as a painkiller for loneliness,
      I've got some touch with
      Rust AWK and GNU Make, BF, J slightly,
      lisp and Typescript.
      I do agree that everything surrounding Typescript
      is emotionally painful except eth syntax.

      Both for myself and for the University,
      I familiarized with
      C++, Python, PHP, LaTeX, HTML CSS and Javascript,
      Java, Bourne and POSIX shell scripting ("bash" let's say)
      The aforementioned warm-ups were also done
      on languages for the University.
